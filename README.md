# async_pcloud
Async python API client for PCloud

this in an indirect fork of https://github.com/tomgross/pcloud/

## Difference
It's async, using aiohttp. I plan to reimplement all functions, and add extra - implement some of the NotImplemented, make useful combinations.

update: pcloud has too many methods, i won't implement all of them

### why i made this?
because i have not found any async packages for pcloud
